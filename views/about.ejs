    <h2>What is crowdsourcing?</h2>

    <p>Knowledge and ideas are decentralized among people. Your co-workers may not have the best answers. Crowdsourcing means outsourcing something you want to achieve to a large network of people in the form of an open call. It works brilliantly for innovative engineering solutions and ideas generation.</p><br><br>

    <p>Many problems, opportunities, and projects benefit from being exposed to different perspectives. To people and teams, in other words, with multiple dissimilar backgrounds, educations, problem-solving approaches, intellectual and technical tool kits, genders, and so on.</p><br><br>

    <p>Technology is making it progressively easier to access the knowledge, experience, and resources of the crowd. Thanks to our growing connectivity, it is now easier than ever for individuals to collectively contribute ideas, time or expertise to a project or cause.</p><br><br>
